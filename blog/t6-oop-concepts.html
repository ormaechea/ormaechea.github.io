    <h3>What are Variables?</h3>
    <p>Straight up. There is no other way to digest this. Variables are the memory locations holding data that can be used in the program. A variable can be seen as a place to store data. All variables are unique and they refer to a specific object located in memory and they do this by pointing to that object in memory wich is the famous definitions of "pointers."</p>
    <p><code>variable=5</code> -> To access the variable it has a pointer that stores [5] in memory.</p>
    <h2>Type of variables?</h2>
    <p>There 5 types of variables in ruby that are:</p>
       <ul>
      <li>CONSTANT=5</li>
      <li>$global=5</li>
      <li>@@class=5</li>
      <li>@instance=5</li>
      <li>local=5</li>
    </ul>
<p>Constant variables are like normal varibles but it's value is supposed to remain the same thru out the whole program. Global variables can be accesed from anywhere in the program. Class varaibles exist over ALL instances of a class it is like saying that all instances from that class have something in common. Instance varaibles are variables that belong to each instance of the class. Local variables can be accessed on the block where it was defined only. </p>
    <h3>How to use variables</h3>
    <p>Let's take for example local variables.</p>

    <p><h5>def information
      <br>&nbsp name=andres
      <br>&nbsp age=andres
      <br>&nbsp info=[name,age]
      <br>&nbsp return info
      <br>end</h5></p>

<p>They can be accessed only in the information method scope. We can se here how we return the array that we assigned a variable with the name of info.</p>
