  <h1>Dev Bootcamp's Secret ingredient</h1>

      From my personal experience so far and what I have researched online and offline about Dev Bootcamp are positive signs and I consider myself a "positive critic" kind of person. The curriculum so far is very well oriented to transform a human into a developer and I say this because they cover ALL the topics and when I mean all I say mind, body and soul. DBC even worries about your tweeting habits and social network integration in the tech-community.
      I made a weighing matrix that I will publish later that compares all big coding bootcamps in various aspects. I used this to make my decision and here I am blogging about it.

    Straight up: DBC does not give you the fish. DBC shows you how to build the fishing rod and puts you in an environment where you learn how to fish with the set of tools offered and interactions with your classmates (in this case survivors!). This is my first week at Dev Bootcamp and so far it has ensured me that my decision (investment considering time, money and effort) is on its predicted path. This is an environment where you put yourself to the challenge and only you decide how far you want to go and learn. So far this week I have learned too much and passed barriers I did not know I was capable of for example: working with Git and Github thru terminal is something I can handle now. It may sound stupid to some of you but it was a personal barrier for me.

    I am very excited to be part of this program. Oh and at DBC they make you try meditating. My mom once took me to a meditation class and I fell asleep. But I will give it another shot! DBC even worries about your mental health. Awesome right?
