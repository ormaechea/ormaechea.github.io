  <h2>A story of a Venezuelan with a second chance</h2>

    I was born and raised in Caracas. Venezuela is one of the most complete and diverse countries I have ever seen. It is not only rich from its petroleum industry but its people and the natural infrastructure. Even tho we are the most dangerous country in the world with 25.0000 "violent" deaths we are able to wake at five in the morning to start our day and with a smile!

    So you may be asking youself what does this have to do with coding? Precisely, I just graduated from  CS degree and was forced to leave my country and start all over again. So I will be posting about my journey attending an intensive development bootcamp that hopefully will help me survive outside my home country.
