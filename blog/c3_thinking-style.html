      There are various thinking styles and lets list them really quick so you get glimpse at them:
      -Concrete Sequential: tend to be based in reality. They process information in an ordered, sequential linear way.
      -Concrete Random: EXPERIMENTERS.
      -Abstract Random: organize information thru reflection and thrive in unstructured, people-oriented environments.
      -Abstract Sequential: love the world of theory and abstract.
    </p>
    <p> When I took the test it said that I am an Abstract Random thinker. So basically what I understand and feel when I think is that ideas just pop right out of my head and I try tu pt the pieces together and start giving shots until the right anwser comes to my mind. So basically I consider myself a little distracted sometimes but when I start solving problems ideas just pop out of my head and I begin with trial and error. Also I learn a lot with experience so if I want to learn something jsut practice it many times and with different cases or in different ways. Literally practice keeps my mind sharp because my memory is really bad.

      So far, DBC has been awesome and what I learn I always keep track in my HUGE notebook. See that the thing I need to experiment and practice so that is why i write everything down right AFTER I understand it and if not I write it down for asking later. The biggest struggle right now is putting in practic all that we have learned in these three weeks but so far it is looking good.

    <h3>Fixed vs Growth Mindset</h3>
    <p>So this is a very important topic apparently in DBC... and I cant agree more. This is what determines your success in life how far do you want to go. Do you know how far you can go? NO the anwser is NO and that is because you can estimate your capabilities but not as a fact so you can always push yourself to the limit and yeah... you will never know how good you can be.
  </p>
  <p>A fixed mindset is someone who puts limits to himself and says I know I can go up to here and that is it I am not learning more than that. Instead Growth Mindset is someone who is abosorbing knowledge everytime and learning from their wrongs so next time they cna be better and this way improve constantly and theese type of person tends to thrive a lot more than someone who basically limits him or herself. So get out of your comfort zone and you will never know how far you can go, so just keep on going!
