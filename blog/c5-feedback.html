    <h2>Code Pairing!</h2>
    <p>
     Pairing for a coding challenge is one of the most beneficial things in programming. It makes you develop skills of working in an enviroment that it is not usual. Remember that the new coding way is not just grabbing your computer in going solo for a bunch of hours. There are a lot of methodologies that are being implemented now that the new way to go is programming in teams!
    </p>
    <p>So code pairing helps you in a bunch of ways that are listed below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Helps you understand new ways of solving the problem</li>
      <li>Can see how others approach the problem</li>
      <li>Two minds are better than one</li>
      <li>Being self-aware is very important</li>
      <li>Learn to be patient</li>
      <li>Learn to be kind</li>
      <li>Learn by teaching</li>
      <li>Learn to handle difficult situations in teams</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback</h2>
    <p>Feedback is one of the most important things in life! Getting feedback is like getting a grade but 99 times more realistic. Feedback is a concized general and distribuited approach of your engagement in the challenge.Concerning all the topics being evaluated in that feedback this helps you understand in what you are failing most and what you are doing great to keep improving it!</p>
    <h2>How to handle the feedback?</h2>
    <p>If you are receiving feedback keep in mind that you trust yourself and you know what you are doing. First rule: do not hold it agains anyone for giving hard feedback. It is very important to keep your concentration on taking the "good stuff" improving it and also take the bad and use it as a force to put more effort in your weaknesses.  Always look at feedback as "positive criticism" or "constructive criticism"</p>
    <h2>How to give feedback?</h2>
    <p>There are three important words that describe what you feedback should be like:
    <ul>
      <li>Actionable</li>
      <li>Kind</li>
      <li>Specific</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feedback should actionable refers to your comments should be able to put in to a practical matter. For example you should improve your typing velocity. That is actionable words can be put in to actions straight away.</p>
    <p>Kind refers to not being agressive or disrespectful. There is no room for intolerence and being rude. If you have to criticize you can do it in a nice way. Remember it is not what you say but how you say it!</p>
     <p>Specific is right to the point. Giving specific feedback is not just talking general topics of improvement or criticism it refers to characteristics of the situation.</p>
</p>

<p>Hope this helped!</p>
