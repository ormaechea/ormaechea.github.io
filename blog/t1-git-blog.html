     This blog post is going to be very precise but also informative so be enthsiastic about reading this!
     Many of you are asking yourselve's why Version Control exists? And the quick anwser to this is because programmers can go back if they make a mistake in their code. Also it helps programming teams organize for each member to work on something different so then later they can put the pieces together! Easy... Right? Lets keep moving quickly!

        Git!
        So Git is the local repository in your computer. Git helps you keep track of changes locally so then they can be sent to Github so you never loose your work. But dont get ahead of yourself... Git basically works offline alone.

        So what is Github?

        Github is simple. It is used to keep track of your changes remotely in some servers in California so like I said your code is protected! and the best thing about it is that other people can see it! if you want tho...
        So how do Git and Github work together? Well awesome question. You first work locally in your computer and then push (send files) your changes to Github in Github.com and viceversa you can also pull (receive files) files to your computer so you can work with them!
