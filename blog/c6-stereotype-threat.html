    <h2>What is Stereotype threat</h2>
    <p>Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group (Steele & Aronson, 1995).</p>
    <p>In my own words Stereotype  Threat is the negative thoughts we produce when judging people by what they look or seem to us. Lets move tot he next topic I preffer on talking about how to work and do the possitive so this "threat" concept can be evaded.</p>

    <h2>How to focus on the good side</h2>
    <p>I like to always take positive vibes. So from now on lets talk positive. When approaching a group of people the mentality I go with is very open for ideas and people no matter what you wear, think or do. This way you can benefit more in general you dont have a "mediocre filter" I call it that could be an opporunitty gone to waste...</p>
    <h2>Hit first hit hardest!</h2>
    <p>Always approach people in a nice way. You never know if that guy wearing tattoed sleeves is the one who is going to finance oyur project! Or even they gperson who helps you go from good to AWESOME.</p>
    <p>So my recommendation is next time you approach people be more open and nice. Being self aware of the people around you is what makes the difference.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
