    <h3>Classes</h3>
    <p>
     In programming we work with objects and they have certain characteristics or properties. Like a car for example it has four (4) wheels, four (4) doors, one (1) engine and a quantity of passengers. Many other "things" or parts of the car can be listed but this is for the sake of the example. So when creating a Car in programming you have to set those characteristics, how many doors is the car going to have? how many passengers? how many wheels?
    </p>
    <p>Now that we understand how OOP (Object Oriented Programming) works we can go straight to the definition. A class is a blueprint of the object it has the properties it needs to be set when created so it can do its "proper" functionality. No car ever is going to be created without wheels or passengers right? For now tho... hehe</p>
    <h2>When to use classes?</h2>
    <p>Classes are used when creating objects. If you have a program that needs interaction of certaing objects there must be a class per object. Each object that is created has a parent that is its class. The relation is 1Class to n-number of objects.</p>

    <h3>Why classes?</h3>
    <p>Classes let us organize the characteristics of the objects and its functionality. And as we use OOP this type of organization lets objects interact based on their creation, characteristics and functionality.</p>
     <h3>How to use classes?</h3>
    <p>COMING SOON...</p>

    <h3>Classes similar to real world?</h3>
    <p>Classes make us go one step closer to similutaing the realworld in OOP. You can see it as a real situation implemented in programming. Let's say we want to literally create humans in a program for a database of a school. So the class would be called "Person". Can you think of any characteristics that person would have? I do: age, height,weight, hair-color and guardians-name. So you see everytime you create a student (from the class Person) you will have to set those properties and assign them a value. This is how close to the real world it gets.</p>
