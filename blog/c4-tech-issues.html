    <h3>Programmers... Needed?</h3>

    <p>There has been notice a lot of information on the web of organizations and groups of people that are trying to biuld a platform that helps building applications trying to evade the coding or at least the most of it they can. Truth is that theese tools such as "AppGini" or "AppMakr" can be very useful to some certain groups that do not have the budget or dont want to give in the time to make their they just want to be as I say "In the comfort zone".</p>

    <p>I can say this because building software is very detailed and of its kind. What I mean by this is that when software is built (if no code is copied) there are many ways to achieve the functionalities we want to reach and technology changes every day to be more efficient for the better performance of bringing software and hardware together so specific pattern is NEVER established to build software.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there is a better and more straightforward reason that programmer will always be needed. Nobody ever wants to build the same thing then the definition of unique wouldn't be  what moves masses? Again... How far would we go with customization? Wouldn't we like to build and customize our Apps until the last detail as we would like to?</p>
